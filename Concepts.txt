Tableau Public 


-- Pages vs Filters
   When we drag any dimension/measure into the Filter, it creates separate plot for each selection
   When we do the same in Pages, it creates only one plot where we can select each selection or keep all history of selection also.
   
-- Animations
   Format-> Animations
   If turned on, then the plot moves sequentially/simultaneously which makes the animation from last plot to next plot. 
   Set time in sec (fast(0.30sec) ,medium(0.50sec) ,slow(1sec) ,very slow(2sec) )
   Style : Sequential => Bar First change Height and then move based on order
           Simultaneous => Bar Change based Height and Order together.
		   
-- Mark Labels
   Drop the measure in the label and get the label in the plot in diferent points
   Label can be used to get the exact figure in the plot but should not be overriden.
   
-- Annotations
   To put your test on the graph or annotate a specific point on the graph. We can create a link (line arrow) to that particular
   point on the graph to our annotated text.
   Can be Mark,Point or Area.
   
-- Dashboards
   1. Create layout using Objects
   2. Add Different worksheets to Dashboard
   3. Layout for Other application (Device Preview -> Phone)
   4. Apply the filters to all worksheet 
   5. Actions : Let us create interactive relationships b/w data, dashboard objects and other worksheets and web.
   6. Creating drill down/drill through reports (Make 2 dashboards for drill down and add button to go back)
   
-- Tooktip

-- Stories
   Hold dashboard, worksheets and the highlights of particular moment.
   
   
-- Maps
   1. Requires one geo Dimension, 0 to more Dimension, 0 to 1 Measure
   2. Symbol maps : Requires one geo Dimension, 0 to more Dimension, 0 to 2 Measure
   3. Longitute and Latitude are Auto generated.
   4. Grouping Data Manually in Custom Territories. (Using Lasso tool, rectangular and Radial Selection)
   5. Move using a Pan and Zoom using Zoom Area.
   6. Add Backgroung Layer in the map (Layer for US - Population, Per Capita Income, household Income)
   
-- Density maps (or heat Maps)
   Has Blurring of data points and can identify hotspots in an area of the map.
   
-- Hierarchy
   To create parent-child relationship btw country, state, city, postal code and Organize the data.
   Useful in Dependent Searches.
   
-- Sorting Data in Tableau
   Based on Data Source/Alphabetical/Field Based/Manual 

-- Changing Default Properties
   1. Sorting : We can change sort order in default which will apply to all worksheet. But then on top of it we can change
                individual sorting order on each worksheet.
   2. Comments : We can add comments in defualt properties, used when we hover over on field on left pane.
   3. Color : Tableau remember only one color, so default will change it everywhere.
   4. Shape : Tableau remebers only one shape
   5. Number format (Measure)
   6. date format (Dimension)
   
-- Creating Groups
   Add all Midest US Country into One group and include other states into Other.
   Use it in Map, Table Viz
   
-- Creating Sets 
   Grouping Data based on Dynamic Data of other field.
   eg 1 : Get Top 10 Employees by City
   eg2 : Get Top 10 Employees By City where Annual Revenue is not less than 1.5 million. (Combined Set)
   Can be used in Maps 
   
-- AutoGenerated Fields 
   1. Latitude/Longitude : Generated automatically for Geographic Data (Country,State,City,PostalCode). Precise for US.
   2. Measure Name, Measure Values : Calculate all Measure Data (Sum(Revenue), Sum(Sales),Sum(Population))
   3. Number of Records : Counts the Number of records present
   
-- Side By Side Bars:
   Used with Measure Name, Measure Value to compare btw bars.
   
-- Pie Chart:
   Drag and Drop the Sum(AnnualRevenue) in Angle and Country into Color.
   
-- Captions:
   Show/Hide Cards-> Captions 
   Shows at the bottom, useful when printing or adding extra information.
   
-- ToolTip :
   Adding information about particualar area while hovering.
   Can be responsive (Fast)/ Hovering (slow)
   
   We can add Sheet2 into Sheet1 using tooltip to show for particular bar/chart.
   Create a Viz : Having Side-by-Side bar chart to show annual revenue and sales per state per country.
   Edit ToolTip : Add Sheet2 having the Table of Measures of Annual Sales/Revenue.
                  Add Sheet3 having bar plot of measures of Annual Sales/Revenue. Make This applicable for Country only 
				  by editing Tooltip (filter = <Country Region name>), not All Fields.
				  
-- Axes:
   Editing General : Range, Scale (Reversed/Lograthmic), Axis Title, [SubTitle]
   Editing Tick Marks : Major and Minor
   
-- Bins :
   Categorize Measures into sections using a Bin.
   Works with Measures Only and once created the Bin is a Dimension.
   Sign : Histogram 
   We want no of employees 0-10, 10-20, 30-40 for all organization.
   
   eg : Number of Employees (upto next 10) per Number of Record.
   
-- Histograms :
   They are Charts that display shape of a distribution. Looks like a Bar Chart but groups values of a Continuous Measure
   into Ranges which Tableau Calls Bins.
   Select Continuous Measure and click on Histogram Viz. It will create a plot with NumberOfEmployees vs CNT(NoOfEmployees).
   Requires One Measure and creates a Bin.
   
-- Heat Map :
   Number of Employees in each country per Speacialty => Create cross Tab.
   Drag the NumberOf Emplyees to color => Will Change to a Heat Map in the Same Table.
   
-- TreeMaps :
   Drop one Measure into Size and One Dimension into Label and Click on TreeMap.
   Convert heatMap into TreeMap by Clicking on TreeMap.
   Best used for Heierachical data.
   
   Dimension Define the Structure and Measure Defines the Size or Color.
   
-- Dual Axis /Combined Axis :
   Drag and Drop Sum(AnnualSales) and Sum(AnnualRevenue) into Rows and Country into Column.
   This creates Two Charts.
   If we want one, Right click => Dual Axis.
   Dual Axis creates the same chart for both.
   
   Click Syncronize Axis to make both Axis Range same.
   
-- Scatter Plots :
   Requires 2-4 measures.
   When Sum(AnuualRevenue) and Sum(AnnualSales) and Country(Column) and Specialty (row)
   Detail = Country / State / City 
   Creates multiple Synchronized Scatter Plots.
   We can compare btw diferent Country and Specialty , all the outliers.
   
-- Instant Analytics : Constant and Average Lines
   1. Constant Lines :          This is constant line for entire Graph plot.
   2. Average Line =>           Table : Average of entire Table.
					            pane : Average on each pane. For eg : Average across states in each country.
					            Cells : Average of cell itself. Will be on top. Makes no sense.
   3. Median With Quartiles =>  Table : Gives Median, Upper Quartile (Max of .75 per), Lower Quartiles (Min. of .25 per)
                                Pane :  Gives it for each pane.
								Cells : Cell itself.
   4. Totals                =>  Row Grands Total : Create one Total plot at the end.
                                Column Grand Total : Create whole plot by doing total of independent plots at the bottom.
								SubTotals : 
   5. Average with 95% CI   =>  Table, Cells, Pane 
   6. Median with 95% CI    => Table, Cells, pane 
   7. Reference Line `      => Has all the options of Min,Max,Constant,Sum,Avg,Total.
                               Can change the default Label, and Tooltip.
							   Formatting : Colour the background above/below the reference line independently.
   8. Reference Band        => Reference bands shade an area behind the marks in the view between two constant or 
                               computed values on the axis
							   Scope : Entire Table, Pane, Cell.
                               Band From and Band To : Area of Band in Distribution Chart,
							   Eg: Band From : Sum(AnnualRevenue) = Maximum
							       Band To   : Sum(AnnualRevenue) = Average
								   Decide the Label; and toolTip, Line Formatting, Fill.
   9. Distribution Band     => Reference distributions add a gradient of shading to indicate the distribution of values 
                               along the axis. Distribution can be defined by percentages, percentiles, quantiles or 
							   standard deviation.
							   Computation : Percentages separated by commas: 60,80,95
							                 Percentiles separated by commas
											 Quantiles : No of Tiles : 3,4,5
											 Standard Deviation : -1,1 ; -2,2 : 1 is 78% confidence interval
											                      (Useful for outliers, one which is way away from norms)
							   Formatting  : Fill Above, Below, Symmetric, Reverse 
							   ToolTip, Label 
   10. Box Plot (Box-and-whisker Plots) : Upper Whisker, Upper Hinge(75 Percentile), Median, Lower Hinge (25 percentile), Lower Whisker
							They show the distribution of values along an axis. Boxes indicate the middle 50 percent of the data 
							which is, the middle two quartiles of the data's distribution. The remaining 50 percent of data on 
							both sides is represented by lines also called whiskers, to display all points within 1.5 times the 
							interquartile range, which is all points within 1.5 times the width of the adjoining box, 
							or all points at the maximum extent of the data
   11. Bullet Graph         => A bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph developed to replace dashboard gauges and meters. 
							   A bullet graph is useful for comparing the performance of a primary measure to one or more 
							   other measures.
					           1 or more Measure/ 0 or more Dimension 
							   Refernce line for one measure/ Distribution band for other Measure (60,80%). We can change it and 
							   Swap/remove reference line fields
   12. Trend Lines /Trend Model
   
-- Statistical Summary Card : Icon at the top.
                        Count : No of Marks in the view/ selection 
						Sum   
						Average 
						Minimum 
						Maximum 
						Median 
						Standard Deviation
						First Quartile : 25th percentile 
						Third Quartile : 75th Percentile 
						Skewness  : A measure of the tendency of your data to have extreme values to one side. 
						            Positive skewness means the extreme values are to the right, 
						            while negative skewness means the extreme values are to the left
						Excess Kurtosis : A measure of the tendency of your data to have more extreme or outlying values than a 
						      normal distribution.A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 so this value is kurtosis minus three
							   
-- Quick Table Calculation => Running Total : Sum of all previous
                              Difference : last and current
							  Percent Difference
							  Percentage of total 
							  Percentile 
							  Rank 
							  Moving Average (Avg of last 2 to current)
							  
-- Paretos: Engineer that made calculation that 80% of land is on 20% of the population (80/20 principle)
            * Create dual axis for Sum(AnnualRevenue), make one as bar graph and other as line chart, convert the line using 
			  quick table calculation to Running Totals (then add the secondary calculation of percentage on totals).
			  Using this graph we can see 
			  Top 20% cities giving 80% of revenue. (Pareto Chart)

-- Gantt Chart : A Gantt chart shows the progress of the value of a task or resource over a period of time. 
                It is extensively used in project management and other types of variation study over a period of time. 
				Thus, in Gantt chart, time dimension is an essential field.
				A Gantt chart is a bar chart that lays out project tasks and timelines linearly
				1 date,1 or more Dimension, 0 or more measure.
				eg : Show the duration from start day, of activities carried out at all house construction by house number.
				
-- SparkLines : A sparkline is a tiny chart in a worksheet cell that provides a visual representation of data. 
				Use sparklines to show trends in a series of values, such as seasonal increases or decreases, economic cycles
				or to highlight maximum and minimum values.
				eg : Make a Line Chart for each House tasks (Build Interior, Build Roof) with each Year,Quarter (Continuous).
				     Show count of houses that were completed.
					 Hide the Column headers.
					 
-- Create Calculated Field : Duration ,   DateDiff('day',[start],[end])+1     Symbol : =#
							 Plot     ,   Ceiling([House]/5)    - Convert to descrete
							 
							Adhoc Calculation : Directly double click on row/column and add the calculation with creating dimension.
							
-- TrendLines  : Linear, Logarithmic, Exponential, Power, Polynomial (degree : 2,3,--8)   => These needs both axis to be date or number
                Show confidence bands
				R-squared (R2) : is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable 
				                 that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.
								 R-Squared value is a quantifiable analysis of how well the line of best fit (linear regression model) 
								 fits your data.
				p-value        : is the "probability" attached to the likelihood of getting your data results 
				                 (or those more extreme) for the model you have.

-- ForeCasting : Tableau uses exponential Smoothing model.In exponential smoothing, recent observations are given relatively 
                more weight than older observations. These models capture the evolving trend or seasonality of the data 
				and extrapolate them into the future. The result of a forecast can also become a field in the visualization 
				created.
				
-- Quick Table Calculation : YTD Total : the function calculates a running total for the quarters across the subcategories. 
                                         So the value for Q2 is the sum of Q1 and Q2.
                             Compound Growth rate : To calculate the compounded growth rate we calculate the geometric mean 
										 for the numbers.
										 Product A has a growth rate of 15% and 17% respectively for two years. 
										 The compounded growth rate would be the geometric mean of these two.
							 Year over Year Growth : the comparison of one period with the same period from the previous year.
							 YTD Growth : YTD growth is an extension of YTD function. Instead of running total this function 
							            calculates the % change in the value as respect to the previous value.

-- Relationships Vs Joins in Tableau :
    Relationships : Created on Logical layer and denoted by using a line. 
                   Relationship are described based on Comman field between tables and the Cradinality (M-M,1-M)
				   Tables are separate. Tableau prefers Relationship over join.
				   They as faster performance compared to joins.
				   
	Joins :        Created on Physical layer. One table is made.
	               Joins are static and once created affect the data in entire workbook.
				   Outer join is same as relationship but if table are huge then this affect the performance.
				   
-- Creating data source with multiple connection.
   Add two worksheets and then in Sheets (Replace Data source)
   
-- Calculations: Working with Aggregated Data 
    Ex1 :Craete a Calculated field 
            TotalCost = [Cost] * [Number] 
         Create a calculate field 
		    GreaterThan2500$ = If Sum([TotalCost]) > 2500      Sum is a Aggreagation (VizQL Language)
			THEN "Too Much" 
			ELSE "NOT TOO MUCH" 
			END

    Ex2 : HouseCost = If SUM([TotalCost]) > 2500 THEN "Too Much"
	                  ELSEIF SUM([TotalCost]) > 2000 THEN "Intermediate"
					  ELSE "Too Cheap"
					  END
					  
		  HouseCost = IIF( SUM([TotalCost]) > 2500 or SUM([TotalCost]) < 2000, "Investigate", "Just Right" )
		              Drop in colour 
					  
    EX3 : To create a Table where only Decorator cost is shown.
		  DecoratorCost = CASE [Resource] WHEN 'DECORATORS' THEN [TotalCost]
	                      ELSE 0
						  END

    EX4 : String Manipulation
	      Resourse = left([Resources])
		           = [Resources]+' ' +[Resources]
				   = Upper([Resources])
				   = find([Resources],'c') = 7   or findnth()
				   = contains([Resources],'source') = true
				   = endswith([Resources,'s']) = true
				   = replace([Resources],'s','ss')
				   = right([Resources],7) = es 
				   = rtrim()
				   = split('a-b-c-d','-',2) = b
				   = split('a-b-c-d','-',-2) = c
				   
	Ex5 : Date Manipulation 
	      Date = DATEADD('month',3,[startdate]) 
		  Date = DATEDIFF(datePart, startDate, endDate, [startoftheweek])
		  Date = DATENAME('month',[startdate])
		  Date = DATEPARSE('dd.MMMM.yyyy',"15.April.2004") = 15-April-2004 12:00:00 AM
		  Date = DATEPART('month',[startdate]) = 1---12
		  Date = DATETRUNC('quarter',"2004-08-15") = 2004-07-01 12:00:00 AM
		  Day(), ISOWEEK(),MONTH(),QUARTER(),NOW(),TODAY()
		  
    Ex6 : Arithmetic Calculations 
	     ABS(-7) = 7
		 CEILING(), FLOOR(),ROUND(),SQUARE(),SQRT(),POWER(),MAX(),MIN(),DIV(),RADIANS(),SIN(),COS(),TAN(),ASIN(),etc
		 
    Ex7 : SubTotals and GrandTotals:
	    Go to Analytics and add ROW-GRAND-TOTAL, COLUMN-GRAND-TOTAL 
		Then add SUBTOTALS. (This will show subtotal year wise for different quarter for all dimension values)
		Can also do Max,MIN,AVG 
		  
-- Type Conversion
   STR() : "The date is "+str([Date])
   Date() : If you got the date in string format then use this function. date([datestring])  
   MAKEDATE(Year,Month,day) :If you got date as actual numbers like year then use makedate. Return a date value constructed from year, month, day
   DateTime(), MAKEDATETIME(Date,Time) : Can concatenate Date and Time fields 
   float(), int()
   
-- Advanced Calculations :
   Quick Table Calculation YTD = Running_SUM(SUM([DURATION]))
                           MTD (Uses exactly same thing, we can change the "Restarting every" = Month of start)
						   
   Year Over Year Growth = (ZN(SUM([Duration])) - LOOKUP(ZN(SUM([Duration])), -1)) / ABS(LOOKUP(ZN(SUM([Duration])), -1))
                          ZN()                             = If Null then 0
						  LOOKUP(ZN(SUM([Duration])), -1)) = Previous Year
						  
   INDEX() : This function is used to index the data (for eg : bars in bar chart) from 0 to end.
   FIRST() : Gives how many indexes it is away from first (starts from 0 to -1,-2,....)
   LAST() : How many indexes away from LAST() (eg : 24,23,...0)
   RANK(SUM([Duration])) : Ranks the bars by acsending order. (It is actually ascending)
   RANK(SUM([Duration]), 'asc') : Ranks in descending order  
   
-- Creating a Predictive Model :
   Create a Line chart of Month([start]) vs sum([Cost]).
   Prediction = MODEL_QUANTILE(0.5,sum([Cost]),attr([Start]))   => attr used beacuse sum is a aggregation, this gives straight line.
   Add as dual axis for this.
   
   Prediction = MODEL_QUANTILE(0.5 , sum(Cost), attr(DATETRUNC('month',[Start]))  ) => Beacuse we want for each month, now gives curve line.
   Go To Month => Extend Date Range : a week, 2 week,month,year,etc.
   As the data for last month 2023 is incomplete , drop the start date into filter and keep it till december.
   Now, this gives steep curve at end.
   
   Change it to Galsian Process Regression (GP), used when continuous domain like time.
   MODEL_QUANTILE("model = gp",0.5,sum(Cost), attr(DATETRUNC('month',[Start])) )
   
   Median = 0.5, high = 1, low = 0
   
   Model_Percentile() = Tells how close you are to the model. 
   MODEL_Percentile(sum(Cost),attr(DATETRUNC('month',[Start])) ) then drop in colour to know how close it is to the model.
   
-- Parameters:
   Create a Parameter "MinCost" (Int) with Value 1. You can add Min,Max,StepSize for Slider/Type In.
   Then create a calculated field "IsMinimumCost" = Sum([cost]) > [MinCost]
   Drop in filter and select true. 
   No, If we change the MinCost then the Viz will change based o calculated field.
   
   Create a String Parameter WhichResources, Add allowable Values = Concreaters/Builders/Decorators. Shw this in viz.
   Create IsCreateResource Calculated field = .WhichResources and add in Filter.
   Now, this will select only one specific Resource Type.
   
-- Dynamic Parameters:
   Instead of craeting a fixed List in Allowable Value, Use "When Workbook Opens" , select the field to use.
   Edit WhichResources and select Resources in allowable Value.
   
   Parameter with Reference Line.
   If we change the Viz to area chart and add Contant Line from Analytics Section.
   Edit the Contact Line and add Value = MinCost (Parameter)
   Now, the Line and area both will change with Dynamically with user input.
   
-- Swap sheets using Parameters in dashboard 
   Create a Parameter "Which Viz?" add List as Area/Line/Bar.
   Create a Parameter "WhicViz" = "Which Viz?" and add to Filter (Custom value list as "Area" for Area Chart).
   Create a Dashboard and add all three Viz in same Object. Hide Title, Change the parameter value and switch between the Vizzes.

-- Calculate Percentage of Running Total Over Entirely of Data.
   Add Sum(SalesVolume) => Convert to table Calculation and select Running Total, Sum, Table Down.
   Add Secondary Calculation as Percentile (Ascending) , Table Down.
   
   Add regions in columns. Now we have percentile for each year each region.
   Drag the Quick Table Calulation into Measure. Ne field "CumulativePercentile"
   
   Create Calulated field "IsOver50%" = If CumulativePercentile > 0.5 then 1 else 0 end 
   Drop in Colour, change ComputeUsing-> Table down.
   
-- Fixed LOD (Level Of Detail)
   Lets do it without the table calculation
   
   SalesVolumeRunningTotal = Running_SUM( SUM([SalesVolume]) )
   SalesVolumeGrandTotal = { fixed : SUM([SalesVolume]) }      => This is the fixed Grand Total.
   Percentage = SalesVolumeRunningTotal/SUM(SalesVolumeGrandTotal)   => Sum because divident is an aggragation 
   or Percentage = Running_SUM( SUM([SalesVolume]) ) / SUM({ fixed : SUM([SalesVolume]) })
   
-- Context for Fixed LOD :
   Percentage = Running_SUM( SUM([SalesVolume]) ) / SUM({ fixed [Region Name]: SUM([SalesVolume]) })
   Change Compute Using -> Table (down)
   Now Gives Percentage with respect to each Region Name for all years computing downwards.
   
   Percentage = Running_SUM( SUM([SalesVolume]) ) / SUM({ fixed YEAR([Date]): SUM([SalesVolume]) })
   Change Compute Using -> Table (across)
   To get percentages with respect to each year across all Regions.
   
   Percentage = Running_SUM( SUM([SalesVolume]) ) / SUM({ fixed [Region Name],YEAR([Date]): SUM([SalesVolume]) })   => For diff context
   
-- Using Fixed LOD's and Filters: 
   Create a table with year, SUM(SalesVolume), Sum(SalesVolumeGrandTotal) going down.
   Add Column Grand Total.
   Now, as the SalesVolumeGrandTotal is in context with everything. Add Region Name in Filter and select 1 or two values.
   SalesVolumeGrandTotal will not change. To change this with context. RegionName-> Add to Context.   (Will Change to Grey)
   Now the SalesVolumeGrandTotal will chnage with filters.
   
-- Quickly Create Fixed LOD's :
   Drag the SalesVolume Measure holding control key and drop into top of RegionName Dimension. It will create a new calulated field.
   Sales Volume (Region Name) = {fixed [RegionName]: SUM(SalesVolume)}
   Add into the Viz.
   
-- Dynamic Parameters/LOD's :
   If we want to create a Dashboard which Filters the Data on the latest Date.
   Create Parameter, YearNeeded = Integer,Min = 1995, Max= 2016, Step Size = 1
   IsYearNeeded = Year([Date]) = [YearNeeded]
   Add into Filters.
   Now to make this dynamic :
       Create a new Calculated field , MaxYear = { fixed : Max( Year([Date]) ) }
       Edit YearNeeded Parameter, "Value when workbook opens" = MaxYear 
	   
Data Connections

-- Use Calculation in Join clause
   If one spource has table with Activity ID = 1,2,3,... and other source has Activity ID = Activity 1, Activity 2,....
   Then Join of two tables give error symbol.
   Edit Join Calculation -> int( mid( [Activity ID (Part1) ],10,999))
   
-- Create Union

-- Blending:
   Joins can cause duplicate data which can result in agggreagation of values which are unrealistic. If there are two owners 
   it multiplies the total cost.
   Create a new Data connection for HouseOwner Data.
   Convert HouseNumber to Dimension. (1-M link, but not interfearing with primary data )
   This does not affect Sum(Cost) for 2 owners of same house. (Mr and Mrs)   
   
   Blend focus on primary dimension and then add blend dimension (Secondary Dimension) as a blended item.
   Avoid Duplication. (*) if there are more than one value for a particular item.
  
-- Pivot and Data Interpreter
   Data Interpreter : Cleanse the data and identify the values.
   Pivot : Convert all the columns headers and their values into new Columns, one column with header and other with value. (Sim to unpivot 
           in excel).
		   
-- Connecting to Multiple file types and databases:
   Select the text file to choose.
   It will bring all .txt,.csv files to tableau with that connection.
   
-- Split vs Custom Split:
   We can split the column by space,comma,tab by going to custom split.
   Normal Spli works with comma.

   Tableau Server : Is on your on service, on-premises, data in your company(data regulations gdpr).
   Tableau Online : It is in Cloud
   Tableau Public : Has Limited edition. 
                    Can connect to 
					    (To a File ) MS Excel, TXT, CSV, Spatial File, Statistical File,
					    (To a Server) Google Drive, Web data connector.
   Tableau Desktop : Full version.
                        (To a File)

-- Connecting to Relationsl Databases by Using Custom SQL Query:
   Select the Microsoft SQL Server as Data Source. (name = . for local db -> Go to particular databases.)
   We will get all the tableas listed on the left.
   New Custom SQL -> Select * from tblEmployee where dob>'1995-01-01' -> Preview results   
   
-- Live Connections and Extracts (Tableau Online, Desktop Licencensed):
   Extracts : Downloads it into Tableau, Can refresh manually, 
              better performance, 
              reduces load on underlying data, 
			  we can save workbook as packaged workbook with the data. (.twbx)
			  Aggregate data for all Visible dimension.
			  Sharing, gives the access to data
			  
   Live : Uses Live data, 
          User having the live connection, may or maynot have the access to data. (roles)
   
   Whe we select Extract then before going into Vizes tab, it saves it as (Tableau Data Extract).hyper file.
   Now we can save the workbook as (.twbx) and share it to other people.
   
-- TDS File VS TDSX File.
   Data -> Data Source -> Add to Saved Data Sources -> tds (Tableau Data Source) or tdsx (Tableau Packaged Data Source).
   
   TDS : Doesnt include underlying data.
         Include Table name , location of local file, bin, set, calculated field, and all the metadata etc.
		 More Security.
   TDSX : Contains underlying data. 
         Less Secure as access is given to data. Single zip file.
		 
		 
   Data Sources -> Connect -> Saved Data Source.
   
-- Shadow Extracts :
   Tableau creates and saves the Shadow extract in order to load data more quickly.
   It contains underlying data and other information. 
   They are not saved as Tableau Extracts. Cant be used to recover data. They are purely used for informal use by computer.
   Can have upto 5 shadow extracts. It creates new then deletes the oldest.
   Stored in AppData/.../Caching/temporaryExtracts and saved as hhyper file.
   
-- Printing Content and Publishing Visualization:
   File -> Print / Print to PDF.
   Server -> Publish Workbook (By Signing in to Tableau Online)
   
-- Create Extract Filters and Connecting to .hyper files and Publishing to Tableau Online.
   Create a Viz -> Data -> Extract data 
               1. Logical Table : For one table , Physical Table : For Joins of multiple table.
			   2. Aggregate for Visible dimension
			   3. All rows 
			   4. Filter : Extract oly for date > 1999 for eg
   Then to use it, File -> Open -> .hyper file 
   
   Publish : Server -> Publish Data Source (Sign in to Tableau Online or Server first)
			   
			   
-- Schedule Data Extract Refreshes:
   Tableau Online -> Explore -> Data Sources -> Refresh Extracts (daily, hourly, monthly, weekly)
   
-- Subscribe:
   Tableau Online -> Go to workbook -> Subscribe 
                Get it as PDF or image or both monthly, weekly, daily, hourly 
				Add subscribe users 
				
-- Alerts :
   Get alert when the sales volume go over certain range.
   Select the axis (numerical value)
        Condition = Above or equal to , threshold : 600000$
		Send Alert : When- first time it's true , As frequency as possible, hourly daily, weekly at most.
		Recipients
		
-- Data Flow:  Tableau Prep/Online 
   Create muliple operation in a single flow.
   1. Union (Split, Change data type, union)
   2. Join 
   3. Clean (hide fields, add filters)
   4. Pivot
   5. Aggregate 
   6. Output
                    
    Run flow, Schedule Jobs, see result in Data Sources 


****Bonus
  
-- Include LOD
   If we want the monthly average of Sales Volume Per Year.
    
   { INCLUDE Month([Date]) : sum([SalesVolume]) }
   
   Drop into text and change the aggregation to average.
   
-- Exclude LOD 
   { EXCLUDE [RegionName] : sum([SalesVolume]) }
   
   Does exactly the same thing as fixed. However, if we have some other dimensions it will not exclude it from consideration.
   Whereas Fixed LOD exclude everything.
   
-- Spatial Files :
   Describe real world events
   for eg .sph (Shape file) having all the information about maps country district Names Population.
   Drop the GeoDimension in Viz, it will plot it into map.
   
-- Import and manage custom GeoCoding:
   Connect to the data.
   Map-> Geo Coding -> Import custom Geocoding -> The file which is csv and has unique row to join.
   
   Now change the field in file1 to GeographicalRole.
   
-- Use a Backgrround image map:
   
   
-- Understand Performace Optimization:
   1. Parallel Query : 
   2. Data Engine Vectorization : Fast analytical data engine. 
   3. Paralle Aggregation 
   4. External Query caching : keeping results of query.
   5. Query Fusion : simplify query into fewer/simple query.
   

   



***NEW COURSE***

Guide :    https://learningtableau.com/data-analyst-study-guide/

1. Tableau Public will save the Viz in Tableau Public site and therefore has no privac of data.
   Tableau Desktop (Professional) we first have to create extract for same file to save it to Tableau Public. 
       (Server-> Tableau Public -> Save to Tableau Public)

2. Prior to Tableau 2020.2 Tableau created Joins in canvas, now it creates Relationships. (Doble click logical Table to create Joins with Phy tabl).

3. Measures are aggregated to the current level of detail. 
   Dimension increase the level of detail. (Do Segmentation, Subdivision)
   
*4. Discrete : (Headers) with Distinct Value and Categorical colour palette.
   Continuous : (Axes) and continuous color range.
   
5. Auto Generated Fields:
   *Latitude,Longitude,Tablename(count of row),Measure Name (All measure name),Measure Value(will have all calculations of measures).
   Double click the Measure value.
   
6. Which field always creates an axis (Dimension,Measure,discrete,continuous)
   ans : Continuous
   
7. Histograms : Has Bins with equal sizes.
                If we want average profit in a Range 3000-4000 of Sales.
				Drag Sales and add histogram, make bin of 1000.
				Add Average profit in tooltip to get profit in range.
				
8. Maps :
   Both the maps help in analyzing data. 
   While a heat map visualizes and compares different categories of data, (Can be in density map or simple table or graph)
   treemap displays a hierarchical structure of data in rectangles. 
   Heat map visualizes measures against dimensions by depicting them in different colors.
   
9. Bar Charts :
   Normal Bar Chart : Drop sum(Sales) and region in rows/columns.
   Stacked Bar Chart : Drop CustomerSegment into detail and colour.
   Side by Side Chart : Drop the avg(profit)  into the axis.

10. Bullet Charts : A bullet graph is useful for comparing the performance of a primary measure to one or more other measures
                    bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph developed to replace dashboard gauges and meters

    Target Profit = Sum(Sales)/5 
	Add Target profit and Profit to chart and create Bullet chart.
	Add Region for granularity.
   

11. Line Chart (Continuous-YearMonth and discrete-Month), Area Chart (Continuous and Discrete), Dual lines Chart 

*** Bar Chart : How a Measure varies by one or more dimension. (Profit by Region)
    Line and Area Chart : How Measure varies over time. (Profit by Month)
	Dual Axis Chart : How Measure varies on same graph. (Profit and Sales by Month)
	Combined Axis Chart : Dual Axis Chart but instead of making two axis, drop it in same axis.
   
   
12. Dual Line Chart VS Dual Combination Chart:
    Line will have lines and Combination will have lines + bars.
	
**13. Bars in Bar
    add the Profit and ProfitTarget in bars. 
	Drag Measure Name in colour 
	Analysis -> Stack Marks -> off. 
	Drag Measure name in size
	
14. Scatter Plots 

15. Box and Wiskers Plot :
    Requires Measure, one dimension or diaggreagate.
	Gives Median - 2nd Quartile, Upper Hinge (75%) - 1st Quartile, Lower Hinge (25%) - 3rd Quartile, 
	Upper Wisker(1.5 time InterQuartile Range Q3-Q1), Lower Wisker (1.5*IQR)
   
    eg : Discount (diaggragate) by ProductCategory.
	eg2: Sum(Discount) by Product Name in Detail (Dimension)
   
16. Editing Axis, Captions.
 
17. Adding the Mark Label (Sum(Sales) text on each mark)
    Editing the Mark Label -> Sum(Sales) into the Label and edit.
	
	Adding Annotation -> Mark, Point, Area 
	
18. Maps :
    Tools -> Pan, Zoom Area, Rectangular Selection, Radial, Lasso
	Map -> Background Layers -> Style, Washout, DataLayer, palette 
	
	To Know distance between two points, Using Radial Selection Tool
    Map -> Map Options -> Units(Metric) For KM, (US) for Miles
   
19. Data Blending :
    Connecting to two data sources and linking the comman field.
  
20. Use a Background Image Map :
    - Open Street Maps and find a location.
	- Select Export and Save the coordinates, share, download.
	
	- Tableau, Map-> BackgroundImage-> image -> ADD 
	- Map-> background Map -> None (In case we have plotted something on default map)
	- Adjust the axis coordinates so tht they match with image downloaded.
	
21. Sorting :
    For sorting multiple columns -> Use nested for 2nd, 3rd level sorting.
	
22. Filters : 
    If two filters are there -> Select only relevent values.
	
23. Groups, Sets, Hierarchy 
    Groups : Combining data of attribute.
	Sets : Combining top 10 employee names who have highest Profit.
	Hierarchy : 
	
24. Calculated Fields :
    EX1 : For finding Profit to Sales Ratio. You must do Sum( [Profit] )/Sum( [Sales] ), not sum( [Profit]/[Sales]] )
	      beacause our focus is on total profit to sales ratio of a particular customer.
		  
	EX2 : Customer Placing orders in Small business Segment 
          CountD( [CustomerID] )
    
    EX3 : No of Days to deliver an order 
          [ShipDate] - [OrderDate]                       -> Number of Days 
		  DateDiff( 'Month', [OrderDate], [ShipDate] )   -> No Of Months
          [OrderDate] + 5                                -> Add 5 days
    EX4 : Promotion Shipping Cost 
	      If [Sales] > 100 and [Ship Mode] = 'Delivery Truck' 
		  THEN 0 
		  ELSE [Shipping Cost]
		  END 
	
	EX5 : Sum of sales for Xerox Product 
	      Contains([Product Name], 'Xerox')   -> True/False
		  left([Product Name], 5) = "Xerox"
		  
	EX6 : Quick Table Calculation :	
	      Sum(Sales) -> Quick Table Calculation -> Percent Of Total
		             -> Compute Using -> Table across/ down/ table /Pane (down)/ Table (down)
					 
	Ex7 : Rank, Running Total, Moving Average 
	      Moving Average -> Average of last 2 and current, however we can change the no of previous values.
		  
25. Fixed LOD : 
    Q. What percent of Total Sales purchased in 2013 were purchased by the customer who first purchased in 2012.
	
	A. Customer First Order Year = { fixed [Customer ID] : min(year([Order Date])) }
	   Filter Data on 2013 [Order Date]
	   Add sum([Sales]) Percent Total Pill to view.
	   Add [Customer First Order Year]
	   Check for 2012.
	   
	   * LOD expression are evaluated before Fitering. Context Filtering however, is applied before LOD/filter.
	   
	Q. Customer Order Frequency : Find the no of Orders placed by number of Distinct Customers.
	
	A. No Of Orders by Customer = { fixed [CustomerID] : countD([Order ID]) }
	   No Of Distinct Customers = countd([CustomerID])
	   
	   Add both to view to get 
	            [No Of Orders by Customer] (1,2,3,--10) with [No Of Distinct Customers] (1021,304,--)


    Q. Find Number of profitable Days 
	
	A.  IF { fixed [Order Date]: SUM([Profit])  } > 0 
	    THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
		
		Add Date to Axis.
		
	Q. Percent Total = sum([Sales])/ min({ fixed : sum([Sales]) })    -> Will not change with category.
	
26. Exclude LOD :
    If we want to find difference of sum(Sales) for Label and sum(Sales) for Envelopers
	
	Sales -> Craete Parameter 
	Calculated Field -> [Sales for Labels] = IF [Product Sub-Category] = [Product Sub-Category Parameter]
												THEN [Sales]
												ELSE 0
												END
	Calculated Fields -> [Fixed Sale for Label] = {exclude [Product SubCategory] : sum([Sales for Labels]) }
	Difference = sum(Sales) - sum([Fixed Sale for Label])
	
	
27. Blends vs left Joins : 
    Blends do not introduce duplication since aggregation happens before the data sources are combined/linked.
	
	If we have a Sales Traget of 27 on 15/August. 
	Joins will add 27 to all matching data and therefore can result in sum(27+27+27+..) for all rows.
	However, Blends will only add it once.
	
	Better than Bleands are Relationships.
	Blends -> Are like left Joins and only give us data which is majorly in Primary Table 
	          Primary Table left Join Secondary Table 
			  
28. Relationships : Done on Logical Layer 
               Like a Outer Join. It will always give us value.
			   
			   
29. Connect to Tableau Server 
    1. Tableau Desktop -> Sever -> Sign in (Tableau Online) 
	
       Data Source -> Tableau Server (Select Sheet)
	   Sheet -> Create Local Copy

	2. Local Data Source -> Drag table -> Server -> Publish Data Source 


30. Data Extract 
    To improve performance , we can extract data in Tableau Professional in .hyper format (earlier used to be .tdx)
	1. In Data Source -> Extract -> Edit (Logical table, Physical Table) -> Add filters 
	2. We can also Edit -> Aggregate data for visible dimension , hide all unused fields 
	3. Or do Sample Extract, Top row (100) extract eg 

31. Trend Line 
    Add Trend line (Linear, Logarithmic, poynomial, exponential, power)
	
	P-Value : It is measure of Statistical confidence. How confident we are that the model will still be valid if we have 
	          lot more data. 
			  The lower the P-value, greater the statistical confidence.
			  Value below 0.05 are considered "Statistically Significant"
    
	R-Square :Variance explained by the model , eg : R2 = 0.0675 => 6%
	          The R-Squared values tells you how well the trend fits your data. 
			  A value of zero means that your model has no ability to predict the y value, 
			  while a value of 1 means that the model perfectly predicts the y value
	
32. Forecast
    Drag sum(value) to detail and right click -> forecast -> Upper Prediction Interval 
	Lower Prediction Interval
    right click forecast graph -> Forecast -> Options -> Show Prediction Intervals (Make 95 to 99%)
